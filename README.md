# Train Reservation Setup

## About Application

* It is web application that allows booking of seats in a train. Included two modes to book seats: Mode 1 and Mode2.  
* “Mode 1” allows user to book seats by just entering the required number of seats. If user needs n seats and those n seats are available the application reserve those seats. And if the n seats are not present in a single row, then the application will allot the nearest n seats (Based on the concept of sliding window). 
* “Mode 2” allows user to manually select the required seats and then book them by clicking on book button. This feature is added to ease in the testing of Mode 1 feature which was originally asked in Problem Statement. 
* “Reset” button allows user to reset all the 80 seats as available. i.e. all 80 seats will be unregistered.
